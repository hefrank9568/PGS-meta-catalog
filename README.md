# PGS-meta-catalog
Creates a catalog of databases and online platform that catalogs or computes PGS

# PGS Catalog

The PGS Catalog is an open database of published polygenic scores (PGS). Each PGS in the Catalog is consistently annotated with relevant metadata; including scoring files (variants, effect alleles/weights), annotations of how the PGS was developed and applied, and evaluations of their predictive performance

## PGS Catalog - calculating PGS

`pgsc_calc`is a bioinformatics best-practice analysis pipeline for calculating polygenic [risk] scores on samples with imputed genotypes using existing scoring files from theÂ [Polygenic Score (PGS) Catalog](https://www.pgscatalog.org/) and/or user-defined PGS/PRS.

# Polygenic Risk Score Knowledge Base

The purpose of the PRS Knowledge Base is to allow researchers to quickly calculate polygenic risk scores for various traits based on published genome-wide association studies (GWAS).

The PRS Knowledge Base uses data downloaded and curated from the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog and is regularly updated to include the lastest studies, SNPs, and associations.

# PGS-Server

*PGS-Server* is a website that is designed to fit polygenic scores (PGS), also known as polygenic risk scores (PRS), using different PGS methods. Users can upload their own GWAS summary statistics and choose any of the 12 PGS methods for model fitting. In addition, users can also upload the estimated SNP effect sizes to construct PGS and evaluate its accuracy in a separate test data with summary statistics.
